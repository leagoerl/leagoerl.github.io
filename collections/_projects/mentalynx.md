Topic: Data Physicalisation for Mental Health without screens and anonymity of the data presentation so that nothing points directly to mental health data. Only if you know it.

Method: 3D printing, Arduino/hardware programming and building 

Mentalynx is based contemporary art. It will create a painting based off of the emotions one feels, mainly in the morning and evening. The frame can be hung over your bed for example. The frame has multiple staffs that run vertically through it, each supporting multiple cubes that have a different color on each side and can be rotated. This way only you will directly be able to see the dial on the bottom where you can give it direct input about your mood, general mood of the day, or current mood. Based on that the algorithm will decide which cubes will shift into which color and thusly create a new image.

Another idea to be implemented in the future is Mobilé. It is hanging from the celling or on the wall. It one case it can have leaves that retract or open up depending on the mood of the user. In the other case it could be light balls which create a visual colour representation well also changing their suspension level. You can pull a ball with the light you most feel like which makes the other one retract back towards the ceiling making the one that you pulled the focus on it. After a certain time all object will come on the same level so that you can pull your feeling again.
