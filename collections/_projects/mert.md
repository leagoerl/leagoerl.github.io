## "Mert and me - together on the road"

Problem Framing 1:

Most cycling accidents happen during huge traffic jams at colder times of the day because the high temperatures force people to stay longer inside during daytime.

Problem Framing 2:

During traffic jams, a lot of different types of cyclers are on their way causing a lot of problems between sporty people, parents with kids, and commuters.

Problem Framing 3:

The reliance on technology for navigation is a key factor in cyclists being unaware of their environment. Furthermore, there are certain risks in regards of personal autonomy and privacy rising from the huge dependence.

Problem Framing 4: 

The infrastructure of the city was transformed from cars to bikes. Nevertheless, the infrastructure lacks certain ways to be both efficient and safe, resulting in more accidents.

## User
The user group for this project is the everyday person, spanning across commuters, families and sporty cyclists. Our solution should be accessible and relevant for everyone. The barrier to use this product or service needs to be low, since we have a wide variety of users. We do not create specialized and expert equipment. Our solution does not serve special interests, since it should be used by general society. This is necessary in order to ensure good safety on the streets of Munich and tackle the challenges of  its citizens 2035.
